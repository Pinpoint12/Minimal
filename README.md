# 🔍 Minimal

A browser extension that creates a cleaner, more focused web experience by removing distractions, unnecessary UI elements, and the bane of our existence - *ALGORITHM DRIVEN CONTENT*.

## ✨ Recent Updates & Roadmap

### Done
- ✅ Fixed YouTube homepage with minimal search-only interface
- ✅ Added browser tab title cleanup (removes notification numbers)
- ✅ Removed Reddit side tabs with recommended posts, etc
- ✅ Centered YouTube video content after removing recommended videos

### Todo:
- 🔜 Minimalist Reddit homepage
- 🔜 Support for additional websites
- 🔜 Settings panel for specific user control

## 🚀 Features

Minimal transforms popular websites by:

- **Removing distractions** - hides sidebars, notifications, and other attention-grabbing elements
- **Focusing on content** - prioritizes what you came to see, not what sites want to show you
- **Simplifying interfaces** - cleans up cluttered designs for a more peaceful browsing experience

## 📱 Supported Websites

- YouTube
- Twitter/X
- Reddit
- Amazon
- Google
- Yahoo
- Netflix
- Facebook

## 💡 How It Works

Minimal uses targeted CSS and JavaScript to modify the appearance and behavior of websites. The extension automatically activates when you visit supported sites, immediately cleaning up the interface.

### YouTube
Transforms the homepage into a clean search interface and centers video content.

### Reddit
Hides distracting elements and ensures proper responsiveness across all device sizes.

### Twitter/X

# Minimal, the browser extension for peace of mind
Minimal is a browser extension to experience a minimal, less attention grabbing internet experience. Internet should be a tool, not a trap.

You can watch the Minimal introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/Gtf9DYDtsHw)

Minimal is driven by core values:

- The user must actively make choices by themselves.
- A user should easily find the content they are searching for on a page, not the content a platform wants them to see.
- A service provider can convince the user to use their platform, but only through their services' inner quality.
